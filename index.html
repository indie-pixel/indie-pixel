            Hello I'm Indie and this is my website. You can find some things I'm working through and finished projects
            in the
            tabs around here.

            I study Art History and Media Theory at the New School and Fine Art at Parsons. I spend a fair amount of time at museums and
            galleries and work there sometimes. I like thinking about nostalgia and memory in my academic writing and
            painting practice. I love drinking tea and climbing trees.

            Image above is Two Angels Holding a Shroud found in collection at The Met Cloisters, 15th Century Germany. The image at the right is a manipulated picture of an Adoration of the Magi panel at the Met Cloisters. Images not attributed are by me.
